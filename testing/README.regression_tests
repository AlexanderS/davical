Regression Testing
==================

At present these regression tests are basically written to work in my
own environment.  While I am, of course, happy to see patches that make
them more generic they are still very much a work in progress.

In order to run them in your environment you will need to ensure both
the Webserver and Database server run in the 'Pacific/Auckland' timezone
since the regression testing puts a number of events into the database
in a floating timezone, and some responses which are affected by these
events are reported in UTC (mostly freebusy results).

On a Debian system you can do this by adding the line:

  export TZ=Pacific/Auckland

to /etc/apache2/envvars, and the line:

  TZ = 'Pacific/Auckland'

to /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/environment

You will also need to edit regression.conf as indicated in that file.
