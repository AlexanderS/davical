rscds (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for some parts of PROPFIND and MKCALENDAR now in an effort to
    start to work with Mulberry.  Alas an unsuccessful one so far.
  * User maintenance screens are now functional, although they still do not
    allow for manipulation of relationships.  That's OK because they don't
    work out the other end yet either!

rscds (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now working with both Evolution and Lightning+Thunderbird(alpha)
  * Restructured database to show some sense.
  * Initial support for TODO items, although either I have it wrong, or
    Lighning has it wrong.  Lightning can write them, but it doesn't read
    them.
