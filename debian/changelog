    tasks someone else puts there with (e.g.) Sunbird.
  * Started development of a regression testing framework.
  * Cleaned up code to remove as many warnings as possible.
  * Make caldav.php work with 'cadaver' for more DAV love.

    start to work with Mulberry.  Alas an unsuccessful one so far.
