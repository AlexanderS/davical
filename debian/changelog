rscds (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs in caldav-REPORT, which was not working with Lightning.
  * Complete work on PROPFIND so that Mulberry now works.
  * Add MKCOL, which is based on MKCALENDAR, to support hierarchies of
    collections better.
  * Rewrite REPORT to use the new XML libraries.
  * Commence support of relationships and permissions.
  * Write new ics.php which allows export of the full repository (for an
    admin), or a subset of the repository.
  * That new ics.php allows webcal presentation of the calendars also, so that
    even if evolution can't support tasks as CalDAV, it can at least refer to
    tasks someone else puts there with (e.g.) Sunbird.
  * Started development of a regression testing framework.
  * Cleaned up code to remove as many warnings as possible.
  * Make caldav.php work with 'cadaver' for more DAV love.

rscds (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for some parts of PROPFIND and MKCALENDAR now in an effort to
    start to work with Mulberry.  Alas an unsuccessful one so far.
  * User maintenance screens are now functional, although they still do not
    allow for manipulation of relationships.  That's OK because they don't
    work out the other end yet either!

rscds (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now working with both Evolution and Lightning+Thunderbird(alpha)
  * Restructured database to show some sense.
  * Initial support for TODO items, although either I have it wrong, or
    Lighning has it wrong.  Lightning can write them, but it doesn't read
    them.
